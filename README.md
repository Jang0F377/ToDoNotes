# ToDoNotes
  Android app made in Kotlin featuring a Mandalorian motif. Features a login/register page using Firebase Auth. Has better UI/UX with spinners for loading
  states. Firebase Realtime Database was used as a backend. After logging in/registering, your met with the home screen where you can change
  the date to see to-dos you scheduled for some future date. You can, of course, create a new to-do, which will move you to that activity. It will ask
  for a title and description the latter with multi-line ability as well as a date that the to-do is to be done. After posting you will see a success
  or failure toast and returned to the main activity with your new to-do populated (assuming the date was today).
  

# Technologies used:
 * Kotlin, Kotlin Coroutines
 * Firebase Auth, Realtime Database,
 
# What did I learn
  This project I learned how to implement Coroutines and scopes as well as using a ViewModel. 
  I learned to use lifecycleScope to track error & loading states to better manage UI/UX.

  
# Hurdles Overcome
 * Implementing Kotlin Coroutines and lifecycleScopes.
 * Creating layouts in xml
 * Understanding ViewModels and how to use them to manage state between the UI.
